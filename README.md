# Fake-Aadhar-Generator
This project is simply for the purpose of education. The primary objective of this project is to build a deep-learning model to identify and classify (Image segmentation and Classification) the given KYC document and extract the information from them. The model requires tens and thousands of data for better results, and since this are confidential documents, I cannot train the model with original KYC documents (Aadhar, PAN, License).

## Output
Fake KYC Documents (Aadhar card, PAN card and License) in scanned A4 format and its binary mask image for image segmentation
