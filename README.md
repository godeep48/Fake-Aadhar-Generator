# Fake-Aadhar-Generator
This project is simply for the purpose of education. The primary objective of this project is to build a deep-learning model to identify and classify the given KYC document and extract the information from them. The model requires tens and thousands of data for better results, and since this are confidential documents, I cannot train the model with original aadhar documents.
